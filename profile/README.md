# Welcome to the Shoestring Community Github ðŸ‘‹
This is a shared workspace for members of the Shoestring Community that work together to develop and maintain Shoestring solutions as well as the standards and processes that are used to develop them.

## Get Involved
We're always looking for help: 
* Help with ***Testing*** - Are you the type of person that manages to break everything you touch? You could help us ***check that new solutions or updates are ready for release*** and ***troubleshoot reported issues*** so that we can work out what is causing them. Just remember that a Shoestring solution isn't meant to be perfect, but it is meant to be fit for purpose (good enough to do what it's meant to do).
* Help with ***Documentation*** - The person who develops something is often too close to it and can overlook fundamental details that others need to understand, use, and build upon what they've done. You can help by ***pointing out*** gaps in documentation and ***suggesting*** how they can be fixed.
* Improvements
* New Solution
* Code Review and Mentoring
